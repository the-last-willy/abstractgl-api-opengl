# [AbstractGL](https://github.com/the-last-willy/abstractgl)/API/OpenGL

This module is part of the library [AbstractGL](https://github.com/the-last-willy/abstractgl).
It can - and is meant to - work on its own as well.

*OpenGL* has been around for decades and will probably be relevant for a few more.
It is still one of the main entry points to graphics programming and many existing *OpenGL* applications need to be maintained.
Therefore it is still relevant.

*AbstractGL/API/OpenGL* strive to provide a better development experience with *OpenGL*.

Here are the aims of this library by order of importance:

**Seamless.**
It looks like *OpenGL*, it works like *OpenGL* - which means you can use any *OpenGL* documentation and follow any *OpenGL* tutorial !
On top of that it provides additional features and guarantees !

**Refactoring.**
Any OpenGL code can be refactored one expression at a time with this module.
It means that you can include this module and get benefits from using it immediately witout any entry cost.

**Zero-cost.**

**Disambiguation.**

**Typing.**

**Scope bound resources.**

**Feature emulation ?**
